# Up & Running with VueJS

This is all of the code for my course Up and Running with Vue.JS.

## Course Description

This is a course that I have wanted to make for a long time now and I am happy to announce that it is finally here. I have been teaching and using Vue for about a while now and I have to say that it is what excites me about front end development these days.

When I started looking at the current landscape of courses in the Vue community I noticed a couple of things. First, there are some really great courses out there by some amazing instructors. I also noticed that a lot of the introduction material came bundled with hours of additional content that might not be relevant for a beginner. It also could be pretty intimidating to want to learn something new and find a course and that is 25 hours long.

With that, I set out to create a course that taught the basics of Vue to beginners. I had a few goals in mind when I started designing the curriculum for this course.

#1 Keep the course length short

Like Vue, I wanted this course to be approachable and I felt like 1-3 hours was a good target. This course comes with 2 hours of video content and its packed with tons of extras.

#2 Backup lessons with quizzes, exercises, and coding challenges

If you're going to learn how to code you can't just watch someone else do it. That is why I really wanted to make sure that this course included quizzes, exercises, and coding challenges. The coding challenges ask you to build something with what you just learned in the lesson.

#3 Keep it Simple

I wanted to target developers with HTML/CSS/JS experience. This meant that I wanted you to just be able to drop a script tag on a page and go. No prior knowledge of Node or NPM would be needed and we would stay away from installing any command-line interfaces.

I am really happy with the way the course turned out and I hope you find some real value in it.So what are you waiting for, click that enroll button and I will see you inside?
